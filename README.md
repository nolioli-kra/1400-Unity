# 1400-Unity
This repository contains all the projects from the Scripting Essentials class that take place in Unity.

You can also find a copy of my personal game project (Uppercut) which has a 3D movement script written by me.
I plan to build this game as a I build my skills as a Unity developer.

If you go to my account you may also find the DAGV 1400 repository for all of the basic scripting essentials projects
from before we moved to using Unity. 
Here's a link to it https://github.com/nolioli-kra/1400ScriptingEssentials2023
Hopefully you can see by checking my account how often I commit to repositories and see that I am ambitious and looking
to learn as much as I can as a developer.
